# This file can be used on each Continuum server, to both provide initial
# configuration values as well as override any values for local requirements.
#
# Most settings in Continuum can be changed in the Administrative UI, therefore changes here
# are only necessary for host specific customizations.
#
# See https://community.versionone.com/VersionOne_Continuum/Administration/General_Settings/Configuration_Reference

# All Continuum settings have defaults built-in.  The only value
# absolutely required in this file is the encryption 'key'.
#
# (This key is configured during the install process.)
#

# The following values are configured by the installation script.

####### Encryption Key
# NOTE: do not change this setting manually, it must be set by the install script.
# Contact support@versionone.com if you need to change your encryption key on
#     an existing installation.

####### MySql Details
# user, password are set by the install script.
# If the actual database settings change, these values must be changed to match.
# (Passwords must be encrypted.)

####### MongoDB
# default mongo server of 127.0.0.1 will listen on localhost only
# the default Continuum install uses an unauthenticated mongodb install
# if the mongodb.user setting is blank, connections will be made
# without authentication
# Passwords must be encrypted.
